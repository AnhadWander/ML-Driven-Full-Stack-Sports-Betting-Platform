## Model Evaluation Summary

To rigorously assess our machine learning model's ability to predict NBA game outcomes, we conducted **30 rolling evaluations** using 50-game blocks from the 2021‚Äì2024 seasons.

Each run provides key classification metrics and a confusion matrix, helping us analyze performance over time and detect trends or inconsistencies.

---

### Average Performance Across 30 Runs

| **Metric**    | **Average** | **Std. Deviation** | **Definition**                                                                 |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Accuracy      | 0.722       | ¬± 0.069            | Percentage of correct predictions across all games                             |
| Precision     | 0.729       | ¬± 0.091            | Proportion of predicted winners that were correct (`TP / (TP + FP)`)           |
| Recall        | 0.789       | ¬± 0.078            | Proportion of actual winners correctly predicted (`TP / (TP + FN)`)            |
| F1 Score      | 0.754       | ¬± 0.068            | Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall; balances false positives and negatives  |
| ROC-AUC       | 0.797       | ¬± 0.069            | Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes (closer to 1 = better) |

These metrics indicate a **well-performing binary classifier**, with especially strong recall and ROC-AUC scores‚Äîsuggesting the model captures most winners and separates classes effectively.

To better understand the evolution of our model‚Äôs performance across the 30 evaluation runs, we generated a visual comparison of the three most critical metrics: **Accuracy**, **F1 Score**, and **ROC-AUC**.

### Why the HoopBetz Model Performs So Well

The success of the HoopBetz model lies in its **depth of features** and **context-aware design**. Unlike traditional models that rely on simplistic win/loss trends or aggregated stats, HoopBetz leverages a **rich, multi-dimensional feature set** for each game.

#### Key Factors Behind Model Performance:

- **Player vs. Opponent Stats**  
  Incorporates how specific players historically perform against certain teams and defensive schemes.

- **Player vs. Player Matchups**  
  Captures micro-dynamics between star matchups (e.g., guards guarding guards), not just team-level data.

- **Team vs. Team History**  
  Accounts for recurring trends in team clashes ‚Äî rivalries, blowouts, upsets ‚Äî over multiple seasons.

- **Injury Reports & Substitutions**  
  Real-time updates on player injuries and rotations drastically impact outcome probabilities.

- **Player Slumps & Hot Streaks**  
  Considers recent form, usage rate changes, and shooting efficiency over trailing 5‚Äì10 games.

- **Location Context**  
  Home-court advantage, travel fatigue, time-zone shifts, and back-to-back games all factor into predictions.

- **Dozens More**  
  Including pace of play, offensive/defensive rating deltas, foul trends, shot location efficiency, and adjusted ELO.

This detailed, context-aware approach allows the model to go **far beyond the capabilities of betting lines or Elo-only systems**, producing predictions that are **statistically sound and situationally intelligent**.
